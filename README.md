- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mrs-Boston
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Python to supplement my PC-DMIS programming and to create fun personal projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python & some of what it can do (I've barely scratched the surface; there's so much to learn!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been writing/running code for CMM's with Hexagon's PC-DMIS software for 5+ years; that knowledge is helping me understand Python's logic, syntax & special operators. Zero Indexing is new though!
